abstract={Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a rapidly developing field that has seen tremendous progress over the past 15 years. The development of GPR spans aspects of geophysical science, technology, and a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. It is the breadth of applications that has made GPR such a valuable tool in the geophysical consulting and geotechnical engineering industries, has lead to its rapid development, and inspired new areas of research in academia. The topic of GPR has gone from not even being mentioned in geophysical texts ten years ago to being the focus of hundreds of research papers and special issues of journals dedicated to the topic. The explosion of primary literature devoted to GPR technology, theory and applications, has lead to a strong demand for an up-to-date synthesis and overview of this rapidly developing field. Because there are specifics in the utilization of GPR for different applications, a review of the current state of development of the applications along with the fundamental theory is required. This book will provide sufficient detail to allow both practitioners and newcomers to the area of GPR to use it as a handbook and primary research reference.

abstract = "Foreground detection is the first step in video surveillance system to detect moving objects. Recent research on subspace estimation by sparse representation and rank minimization represents a nice framework to separate moving objects from the background. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit decomposes a data matrix A in two components such that A=L+S, where L is a low-rank matrix and S is a sparse noise matrix. The background sequence is then modeled by a low-rank subspace that can gradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the correlated sparse outliers. To date, many efforts have been made to develop Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) methods with reduced computational cost that perform visually well in foreground detection. However, no current algorithm seems to emerge and to be able to simultaneously address all the key challenges that accompany real-world videos. This is due, in part, to the absence of a rigorous quantitative evaluation with synthetic and realistic large-scale dataset with accurate ground truth providing a balanced coverage of the range of challenges present in the real world. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of RPCA-PCP based methods for testing and ranking existing algorithms for foreground detection. For this, we first review the recent developments in the field of RPCA solved via Principal Component Pursuit. Furthermore, we investigate how these methods are solved and if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for foreground detection. Finally, experimental results on the Background Models Challenge (BMC) dataset which contains different synthetic and real datasets show the comparative performance of these recent methods."

abstract={Ultrafast ultrasound is an emerging modality that offers new perspectives and opportunities in medical imaging. Plane wave imaging (PWI) allows one to attain very high frame rates by transmission of planar ultrasound wavefronts. As a plane wave reaches a given scatterer, the latter becomes a secondary source emitting upward spherical waves and creating a diffraction hyperbola in the received RF (radio-frequency) signals. To produce an image of the scatterers, all the hyperbolas must be migrated back to their apexes. In order to perform beamforming of plane wave echo RFs and return high-quality images at high frame rates, we propose a new migration method carried out in the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain. The f-k migration for PWI has been adapted from the Stolt migration for seismic imaging. This migration technique is based on the exploding reflector model (ERM), which consists in assuming that all the scatterers explode in concert and become acoustic sources. The classical ERM model, however, is not appropriate for PWI. We showed that the ERM can be made suitable for PWI by a spatial transformation of the hyperbolic traces present in the RF data. In vitro experiments were performed to sketch the advantages of PWI with Stolt's f-k migration over the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) approach. The Stolt's f-k migration was also compared with the Fourier-based method developed by J-Y Lu. Our findings show that multi-angle compounded f-k migrated images are of quality similar to those obtained with a state-of-the-art dynamic focusing mode. This remained true even with a very small number of steering angles thus ensuring a highly competitive frame rate. In addition, the new FFT-based f-k migration provides comparable or better contrast-to-noise ratio and lateral resolution than the Lu's and DAS migration schemes. Matlab codes of the Stolt's f-k migration for PWI are provided.},
